Passionate Full Stack developer from India. On way to master Programming.

## About Me

Hey there! I‚Äôm a Full Stack Web Developer from Mohali, India, trying to make the internet a bit cooler one website at a time. My job is to create fancy, user-friendly digital stuff, and I‚Äôve done a bunch of projects that show off my skills and creative ideas. Or at least, that‚Äôs what I tell people.

**Leadership and Community Involvement:**

As the Team Lead at the Innovation Club of CCET College, I‚Äôve learned how to lead a group without pulling my hair out. I also help out with _ICT_ training sessions at my college, where I teach government employees how to use computers without breaking them. I help in organising the Talent Hunt cultural program, which is basically a big, fun mess that my college somehow manages to pull together. Plus, I‚Äôm the student coordinator and design **_Jhalak_**, our college‚Äôs digital newsletter.


**Personal Interests:**

When I‚Äôm not glued to my computer screen, you‚Äôll find me strumming my _guitar_. It‚Äôs my escape from the tech world, even if I‚Äôm not quite a rock star yet. Playing music helps me relax and keeps me from going crazy with all the coding.

I am committed to blending technical expertise with creativity in every project, ensuring functional, engaging, and user-centric outcomes. I look forward to embracing new challenges and opportunities in the ever-evolving field of web development.

**About my work**

Let‚Äôs get down to the fun stuff! I‚Äôm all about working on open-source projects and connecting with folks who geek out over the same things I do. There‚Äôs nothing like a good collab to spark some magic. I also work as a freelancer, which gives me the freedom to tackle a variety of exciting projects. One of my proudest achievements is creating a real estate website called [_Shriproperty_](https://shriproperty.com). It‚Äôs a sleek, user-friendly platform that helps people find their dream homes without the hassle. Then there‚Äôs [_A2INFINITE_](https://a2infinite.com), a fun little project where you can download practice worksheets for your kids. Who knew making education accessible could be so rewarding?

**Let‚Äôs make the web a more exciting place, one quirky line of code at a time!**
